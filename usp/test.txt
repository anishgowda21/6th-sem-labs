locked file fcntl() can take an optional third argument.  Whether or not this
       argument is required is determined by cmd.  The required argument
       type is indicated in parentheses after each cmd name (in most
       cases, the required type is int, and we identify the argument
       using the name arg), or void is specified if the argument is not
       required.

       Certain of the operations below are supported only since a
       particular Linux kernel version.  The preferred method of
       checking whether the host kernel supports a particular operation
       is to invoke fcntl() with the desired cmd value and then test
       whether the call failed with EINVAL, indicating that the kernel
       does not recognize this value.
